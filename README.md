# Deep Learning Experiments Playground

A space for hands-on deep learning experimentation, covering classic neural networks, transfer learning, GANs, GenAI and other stuff.  
This repository is intended as lab for learning, study, prototyping, and testing ideas using frameworks like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Hugging Face** and more.

## ðŸš€ Overview

- **Goal:** To experiment with deep learning models, try out new stuff, and explore ML tools.
- **Contents:** Jupyter notebooks and scripts for regression, classification, CNNs, transfer learning, and (future) transformer models and LLM-based agents.
- **Status:** Work in progress; always evolving with new experiments and learnings.
